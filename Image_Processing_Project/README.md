# Image Processing Project: Dream City

This project explores advanced image processing and special effect techniques to create a futuristic and apocalyptic cityscape. Using Python and libraries like OpenCV and PIL, the project enhances images, applies animations, and generates dynamic visual effects.

## Features
- **Image Enhancement**: Techniques like resizing, color modification, and HDR adjustments.
- **Special Effects**:
  - Light beam animations.
  - Drone animations in a 3D-like environment.
  - Scrolling holographic text within predefined areas.
- **Final Outputs**: GIF animations showcasing the transformed city.

## Key Techniques
1. **Image Resizing and Overlay**: Adapting images for a futuristic cityscape.
2. **Dynamic Animations**:
   - Light beams flowing along paths.
   - Drones moving with randomized behaviors.
   - Scrolling text within holograms.
3. **Futuristic Aesthetics**: Combining color overlays, grids, and Gaussian blur.

## Files
- **Documentation**:
  - `Image processing through python.docx`: Detailed description of techniques and results.
- **Scripts**:
  - `Image 1` : Includes images and Scripts for image 1
  - `final.py`: Combines all effects into a cohesive animated GIF.

  - `Image 2` : Includes images and Scripts for image 2
  - `road_extraction.py`: Extracts and processes road images from larger scenes.
  - `resize_road.py`: Adjusts image dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
  - `merge.py`: Overlays road images onto background cityscapes.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Ensure Python and required libraries (OpenCV, PIL, NumPy) are installed.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pillow numpy
