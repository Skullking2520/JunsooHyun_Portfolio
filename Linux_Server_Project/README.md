# Linux Server Project

This project documents the step-by-step configuration and deployment of a server and client system using Rocky Linux and Ubuntu. The tasks involve setting up essential services like DNS, DHCP, email, and web servers, alongside implementing SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.

## Objectives
1. Install and configure a Rocky Linux server and Ubuntu client.
2. Deploy and test the following services:
   - **DNS Server**: Configured using BIND for resolving domain names.
   - **DHCP Server**: Configured using DHCPd for automatic IP assignment.
   - **Email Server**: Configured with Postfix and Dovecot for local email communication.
   - **Web Server**: Configured with Apache to host a basic website.
   - **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Implemented for email and web servers to ensure secure communication.
3. Document obstacles encountered and how they were overcome.

## My Contributions
- Conducted the complete setup and configuration of the Rocky Linux server and Ubuntu client.
- Implemented and tested the DNS, DHCP, email, and web server functionalities.
- Researched and partially implemented SSL/TLS encryption, encountering issues with the email server configuration.
- Documented system configurations, troubleshooting steps, and solutions for various obstacles.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux system administration and configuration
- Network setup and management (DNS, DHCP)
- Web and email server deployment
- Troubleshooting and problem-solving in a Linux environment

## Files
- `Linux_Project.docx`: Detailed report documenting the entire setup process, including configurations, troubleshooting, and results.

## Key Challenges
1. **SSL/TLS for Email**: Encountered difficulties with the self-signed certificate, resulting in a partial implementation.
2. **DNS Configuration**: Resolved issues with incorrect named.conf settings.

## Lessons Learned
- Improved understanding of server management and network protocols.
- Gained hands-on experience with Linux-based services and troubleshooting.
- Enhanced skills in documentation and analysis of complex systems.
