# JunsooHyun_Portfolio
Welcome to my academic portfolio! This repository highlights several academic projects that demonstrate my skills in software development, problem-solving, and teamwork. Each folder contains a specific project with its own description and source code.

## Projects

### **1. Email Management System** *(Team Project)*
This C++ project simulates an email management system, focusing on key functionalities such as user registration, email drafting, and spam filtering. The project demonstrates advanced data structures (linked lists) and algorithms to handle email storage and search operations effectively.

#### **My Contributions**
- Designed and implemented the **Inbox** and **Outbox** modules using linked lists.
- Developed file I/O functionality for saving and loading emails to/from external files.
- Integrated the user authentication system and email management logic.
- Collaborated with team members to design the system's overall architecture.

#### **Features**
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and securely access their inbox and outbox.
- **Inbox/Outbox Management**: Emails are managed using custom linked lists for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Spam Detection**: Filters spam based on keyword detection and email sending frequency.

#### **Skills Highlighted**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
- Custom implementation of linked lists
- File I/O operations for email storage and logging

#### **Files**
- `main.cpp`: The main program logic and menu system.
- `Inbox.cpp` & `Outbox.cpp`: Manage the inbox and outbox functionality.
- `UserManager.cpp`: Handles user registration and login.
- `Filter.cpp`: Implements spam filtering.

### **2. Factory Simulation** *(Individual Project)*
A Java-based project that simulates a realistic factory production line. This project uses multi-threading to coordinate processes such as sterilization, filling, sealing, labeling, and packaging.

#### **Features**
- **Multi-threaded Simulation**: Each production stage is implemented as a separate thread.
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Tracks production metrics, defect rates, and logistics performance.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Ensures thread safety using `BlockingQueue` and `Semaphore`.

#### **Skills Highlighted**
- Multi-threading and concurrency in Java
- Inter-thread communication
- Queue-based task management

#### **Files**
- `Factory.java`: Core factory simulation logic.
- `Sterilizer.java`, `Filler.java`, `Sealer.java`: Represent various production stages.
- `Forklift.java`, `Van.java`: Handle logistics and transportation.

### **3. Blackjack Game** *(Individual Project)*
A simple blackjack game developed in NASM assembly language. This project focuses on understanding low-level programming and memory management.

#### **Features**
- **Gameplay**: Implements basic blackjack rules.
- **Procedural Programming**: Organized using modular assembly code.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of game state in assembly.

#### **Skills Highlighted**
- Low-level programming with NASM
- Understanding of memory and register usage
- Debugging assembly code

#### **Files**
- `Blackjack.asm`: The source code for the blackjack game.
