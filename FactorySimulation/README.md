# Factory Simulation

A Java-based simulation of a factory production line, showcasing multi-threading and synchronized operations.

## Features
- **Multi-Threading**: Simultaneous processes for sterilizing, filling, and packaging.
- **Synchronization**: Uses `BlockingQueue` and `Semaphore` for thread-safe operations.
- **Statistics**: Real-time performance metrics like production counts and defect rates.

## How to Use
1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
